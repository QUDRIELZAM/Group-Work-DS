The variables in the dataset are:




No. – Passenger number (not typically used for modeling)

Survived – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Pclass – Passenger class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third)

Sex – Gender of the passenger (male/female)

Age – Age of the passenger

SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard

PrCh – Number of parents/children aboard

Fare – Fare paid for the ticket
======================================================

Dependent vs. Independent Variables
========================================================

=Dependent Variable (Target Variable):

Survived (This is what we are trying to predict)

Independent Variables (Features):

Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, PrCh, Fare (These are used to predict survival)
Let me know if you need further clarification!



=============================

Independent Variable (Feature) → Plotted on the X-axis (horizontal axis)
Dependent Variable (Target) → Plotted on the Y-axis (vertical axis)

===========================
For the Titanic Dataset Example:
X-axis (Independent Variables): Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, PrCh, Fare
Y-axis (Dependent Variable): Survived
==============================

What preprocessing step Should done on any Dataset 

1-: Handling Missing Values
2-: Remove Duplicates
3-: Convert Data Types
4-: Detect Outliers 
5-: Remove Outliers
6-: Min-Max Normalization
7-: Splitting Dataset into Train(80%), Test(10%) and validation(10%)
